India's significant role as a major coal producer and its ranking in global coal mining emissions highlights the importance of developing effective strategies for emission reduction and achieving carbon neutrality.


Carbon Emissions:

The carbon emissions from coal mines vary based on the scale of operations, the technology in use, and the specific type of mining (open-cast or underground). Here is an estimated breakdown of carbon emissions:

    Open-Cast Mines:
        Open-cast mines typically generate higher emissions due to large-scale excavation and transportation activities.
        Estimated Emissions: 1.5 to 2.0 tons of CO₂ per ton of coal mined.

    Underground Mines:
        These mines have lower surface disturbance but often require more energy for extraction.
        Estimated Emissions: 0.8 to 1.2 tons of CO₂ per ton of coal mined.

    India's Total Annual Carbon Emissions from Coal Mining:
        Total emissions from coal mining in India are estimated to be around 250-300 million tons of CO₂ annually. This includes emissions from direct mining activities, transportation, and associated operations.


Sources of Carbon Emissions in Coal Mining:

    Extraction Process:
        Open-Cast Mining: Involves the removal of large quantities of overburden (soil and rock) to access coal seams. This process is energy-intensive and results in significant emissions from diesel-powered excavators, trucks, and other machinery.
        Underground Mining: Requires energy to ventilate mines, operate mining equipment, and transport coal from underground to the surface. Although emissions are lower compared to open-cast mining, they are still significant due to energy use and methane emissions.

    Transportation:
        Coal Haulage: Transportation of coal from mines to processing facilities or power plants involves diesel trucks, conveyor belts, or trains. Each mode of transport contributes to carbon emissions.
        Processing: Coal processing and handling, including crushing and washing, also consume energy and produce emissions.

    Combustion:
        Energy Production: The primary end-use of mined coal is in power plants, where it is burned to generate electricity. Combustion of coal releases carbon dioxide (CO₂), methane (CH₄), and other pollutants into the atmosphere.

    Methane Emissions:
        Underground Mines: Methane is a potent greenhouse gas that can escape from coal seams and mining operations. Proper management and capture of methane are crucial to reducing its impact.

Emission Factors and Estimates:

    Emission Factors:
        Open-Cast Mining: Typically, 1.5 to 2.0 tons of CO₂ per ton of coal mined. Emissions are higher due to the large scale of excavation and transportation.
        Underground Mining: Generally, 0.8 to 1.2 tons of CO₂ per ton of coal mined. Emissions are lower per ton compared to open-cast but still significant.

    Annual Emissions:
        India’s Total Emissions: Estimated at 22 MtCO2e in 2020 and expected to reach 45 MtCO2e by 2050. These figures include emissions from the mining process, transportation, and combustion of coal.

Mitigation Strategies:

    Emission Reduction Technologies:
        Clean Technologies: Adoption of electric vehicles, improved energy efficiency, and renewable energy sources can reduce emissions from mining operations.
        Methane Capture: Implementing methane capture systems in underground mines to reduce methane emissions.

    Afforestation and Carbon Offsets:
        Afforestation Projects: Planting trees to absorb CO₂ and offset emissions.
        Carbon Credits: Purchasing carbon credits to compensate for emissions and support carbon reduction projects elsewhere.

    Improved Operational Practices:
        Energy Efficiency: Enhancing the efficiency of mining and processing equipment to lower energy consumption.
        Sustainable Practices: Implementing practices that minimize environmental impact and improve sustainability.
