Tracking carbon emissions, especially for industries like coal mining, involves collecting data on various activities and calculating emissions based on established emission factors. Below is a basic Python implementation that demonstrates how you might track carbon emissions for different mining activities.
Python Code for Tracking Carbon Emissions


      # Define emission factors (tons of CO2 per unit)
      EMISSION_FACTORS = {
          'excavation': 0.2,  # CO2 emissions per ton of material excavated
          'transportation': 0.3,  # CO2 emissions per ton-km
          'equipment': 0.5,  # CO2 emissions per hour of equipment use
      }
      
      def calculate_emissions(activity, quantity, distance=0, duration=0):
          """
          Calculate carbon emissions based on activity type, quantity, distance, and duration.
          
          :param activity: Type of mining activity ('excavation', 'transportation', 'equipment')
          :param quantity: Quantity of material or distance (for transportation) or duration (for equipment) used
          :param distance: Distance for transportation (used only if activity is 'transportation')
          :param duration: Duration for equipment use (used only if activity is 'equipment')
          :return: Total CO2 emissions in tons
          """
          if activity not in EMISSION_FACTORS:
              raise ValueError("Invalid activity type")
      
          emission_factor = EMISSION_FACTORS[activity]
          
          if activity == 'transportation':
              emissions = emission_factor * quantity * distance
          elif activity == 'equipment':
              emissions = emission_factor * duration
          else:  # activity == 'excavation'
              emissions = emission_factor * quantity
          
          return emissions
      
      # Example usage
      def main():
          # Input data
          excavation_quantity = 10000  # tons of material
          transportation_quantity = 5000  # tons of material
          transportation_distance = 20  # km
          equipment_duration = 100  # hours
      
          # Calculate emissions
          excavation_emissions = calculate_emissions('excavation', excavation_quantity)
          transportation_emissions = calculate_emissions('transportation', transportation_quantity, transportation_distance)
          equipment_emissions = calculate_emissions('equipment', 0, duration=equipment_duration)
      
          # Print results
          print(f"Excavation Emissions: {excavation_emissions:.2f} tons CO2")
          print(f"Transportation Emissions: {transportation_emissions:.2f} tons CO2")
          print(f"Equipment Emissions: {equipment_emissions:.2f} tons CO2")
      
          # Total emissions
          total_emissions = excavation_emissions + transportation_emissions + equipment_emissions
          print(f"Total Emissions: {total_emissions:.2f} tons CO2")
      
      if __name__ == "__main__":
          main()

Explanation:

    Emission Factors: These are predefined constants that represent the amount of COâ‚‚ emitted per unit of activity. You can adjust these values based on specific data for different mines or regions.

    calculate_emissions Function: Calculates emissions based on the type of activity, quantity, and other parameters. It supports excavation, transportation, and equipment use.

    main Function: Demonstrates how to use the calculate_emissions function with example data for excavation, transportation, and equipment use. It prints the emissions for each activity and the total emissions.

Customizations:

    Emission Factors: Update the EMISSION_FACTORS dictionary with more accurate or specific factors relevant to your mines.
    Additional Activities: Extend the calculate_emissions function to include other activities as needed.
    Data Input: Integrate with a data input system (e.g., web form, database) for real-time tracking and calculations.
